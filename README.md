# Dama-Game
This is one of my favorite childhood games, i had so much fun playing this game so i decided to make it into this app.


#How To Play

It's kinda similar to TicTacToc except that you can move your pawns after the you've got three ones on the board.

This game is meant to be played by 2 players i'd be updating the code so that you can play against the computer
